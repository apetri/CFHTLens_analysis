The removed model is the 24th $$$(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)=(0.37,-0.303,1.345)$$$; the data is taken from one of the random realizations of the removed model, and the covariance matrix is measured from model 17 i.e. $$$(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)=(0.3,-0.88,0.765)$$$.The columns refer to the following (Statistical descriptor, $$$\chi^2$$$ for a random realization of the removed model (before removing), $$$\chi^2$$$ for a random realization of the removed model (after removing), best fit from likelihood maximum, $$$\chi^2$$$ of the best fit)
